/**
 Protocol for a `delegate` of `EtsyCompositionalLayoutBridge` to conform to. `EtsyCompositionalLayoutBridge` queries its `delegate` on whether a collection view `section` has flow layout methods implemented for it or not. If yes, `EtsyCompositionalLayoutBridge` will obtain item sizes and spacing for the flow layout section and bridge it into an `NSCollectionLayoutSection`. If not, `EtsyCompositionalLayoutBridge` asks for an `NSCollectionLayoutSection` to use for the section.
